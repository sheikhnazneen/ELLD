Kernel Synchronization Mechanisms for Multiple devices.

a) Write a character driver for Multiple devices and create 2 device numbers.Use

semaphore to protect the Critical section (write activity) and Use wait-queues to

avoid consecutive write operations.

b) Maintain a Kernel buffer of 50 bytes to Read and Write data.

c) Put write function to sleep using wait-queues after successful write operation

before releasing semaphore.

d) Wake-up sleep(wait-queues) operation only in Read function.

e) Write 2 separate programs for Read and Write for each device.
